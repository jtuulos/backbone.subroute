Backbone Subroute
=================

About
-------

Backbone.SubRoute extends the functionality of Backbone.Router such that each of an application's modules
can define its own module-specific routes.  This eliminates the need for one monolithic Router configuration,
The base router can instead act as a simple delegator that forwards module-specific routes to the
appropriate module-specific SubRoute.

For example, given this URL:
  http:example.org/myModule/foo/bar

...the base router would be responsible for invoking and delegating to the proper module based on "myModule".
The module would then have its own SubRoute which would have its own mappings for the foo/bar part.
